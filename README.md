During my High School and first years of college I had this Pen Drive where I would put most of my projects in there. It has mostly TTRPG projects such as character sheets, images, and code that I have developed to help me out DMing my campaign. Unfortunately, the Pen Drive left us, but I could upload its content on my computer before it broke!
